Pest Prediction from Weather Parameters Using Machine Learning Methods

## Description
This project focuses on predicting pest occurrences based on weather parameters using machine learning techniques. The provided IPython Notebook contains the code and analysis for this prediction task.

## How to Use
To run the notebook and perform the pest prediction, follow the steps below:

1. Click on the "Open in Colab" badge below to open the notebook in Google Colab.
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/your-repo/blob/master/pest_prediction.ipynb)
2. In Google Colab, go to `Runtime` -> `Run all` to execute all the cells in the notebook.
3. Ensure that the dataset in is the correct datetime format
4. Make sure you have the necessary dataset (`filename.csv`) uploaded to your Colab environment. If not, upload the dataset as instructed within the notebook.
5. Follow the instructions provided within the notebook to preprocess the data, train the machine learning models, and perform pest prediction.
6. Feel free to modify the contents inside the notebook.
## Requirements
Necessary libraries are imported into the IPython notebook.
